## synapse-weight-simulation

A simple GLIF-STDP network model created by Nest to simulate the alternation of synpase wieght before and after system consolidation with different poisson spike rate(to simulate various stimulus intensity or the salience of the stimulus relative to background information, like flash frequency). Simulation contains 2 phase-Training and Consolidation, used to simulate the influence made by system consolidation on neocortical synapse weight.
